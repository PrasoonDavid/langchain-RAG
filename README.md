## ✨ Features

- **Advanced Retrieval**: Efficiently search and retrieve relevant information from large datasets.
- **Contextual Generation**: Produce high-quality, context-aware responses using state-of-the-art language models.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale data and high-volume queries.
- **Customization**: Easily adaptable to various domains and use cases.

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-project.git
cd rag-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🖥 Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the RAG system:

```python
from rag import RAGSystem

# Initialize the RAG system
rag = RAGSystem(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", knowledge_base="your_kb.json")

# Generate a response
query = "What are the benefits of RAG in AI applications?"
response = rag.generate_response(query)

print(response)
```

## 🏗 Architecture

Our RAG system consists of three main components:

1. **Retriever**: Searches the knowledge base for relevant information.
2. **Generator**: Uses a language model to generate responses.
3. **Combiner**: Merges retrieved information with generated text for final output.
